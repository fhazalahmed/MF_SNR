# OpenSearch Hosting on GKE with Operator - README

## Objective:
This solution deploys an OpenSearch cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the OpenSearch Operator. It follows Kubernetes best practices, uses GKE Autopilot for management, and integrates secure identity management through GCP Workload Identity. This setup avoids using static credentials and optimizes for security and cost efficiency.

## Prerequisites:
1. **Google Cloud Project**: Ensure you have a GCP project with sufficient permissions to create GKE clusters, IAM roles, and service accounts.
2. **Terraform**: Ensure Terraform is installed and configured to interact with your GCP account.
3. **Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)**: Ensure `kubectl` is installed to interact with your GKE cluster.
4. **GCP Credentials**: You must have a service account with the appropriate permissions and access to GKE resources.

## Terraform Files:
The following Terraform files are used to create the required infrastructure:
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines the variables for the configuration.
- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Contains the values for the variables.
- **`main.tf`**: The main Terraform configuration file for setting up GKE, VPC, subnets, and IAM.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Outputs key information like VPC, subnets, and GKE cluster details.

### Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Set Up GKE Autopilot Cluster

- **Terraform Configuration**: The provided Terraform code creates a GKE Autopilot cluster in your Google Cloud project. It automatically provisions a custom VPC and subnets for the cluster, which gives you more control over networking.
- **Workload Identity**: The code configures GKE Workload Identity, allowing Kubernetes workloads to access GCP resources securely without using static credentials.

To deploy the cluster:
   - Update the Terraform configuration with your GCP project and service account details.
   - Run the following Terraform commands:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

### 2. Deploy OpenSearch Operator

- Once the GKE Autopilot cluster is set up, you'll need to install the OpenSearch Operator in your Kubernetes cluster. This can be done by applying Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Operator and associated CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).

   **Steps to install the Operator**:
   1. Clone the OpenSearch Operator repository or get the necessary manifests from the official OpenSearch GitHub repository.
   2. Apply the CRDs:
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f opensearch-operator-crds.yaml
      ```
   3. Install the Operator:
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f opensearch-operator-deployment.yaml
      ```

### 3. Deploy OpenSearch Cluster

- Define the OpenSearch cluster specification in a Kubernetes manifest (e.g., `opensearch-cluster.yaml`), and apply it to the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f opensearch-cluster.yaml
  ```

This will trigger the Operator to create the necessary resources for the OpenSearch cluster, including pods, stateful sets, and persistent volumes.

### 4. Validate Deployment

- **Check Pod Status**: Ensure that the OpenSearch pods are running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n opensearch
  ```
- **Access OpenSearch**: You can use port forwarding to access the OpenSearch REST API:
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/opensearch 9200:9200 -n opensearch
  ```
  Test access by visiting `http://localhost:9200`.

### 5. Security Considerations

- **Workload Identity**: Ensure that GKE nodes and workloads use the Workload Identity for secure GCP resource access.
- **IAM Roles**: The service account linked to the GKE cluster has the least privilege necessary to interact with GKE and OpenSearch resources.
- **Network Policies**: Use Kubernetes network policies to restrict access to the OpenSearch pods, allowing only authorized services to interact with them.

### 6. Cost Optimization

- **Autoscaling**: Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for OpenSearch to scale the number of pods according to load.
- **Storage Optimization**: Use cost-effective persistent volumes (e.g., standard SSDs) and resize based on usage.
- **Node Auto-Upgrades**: Enable auto-upgrades for GKE nodes to ensure that they are always running the latest stable version with security patches.

## Terraform Files Overview:

}

variable "subnet_name_b" {
  description = "The name of the subnet in us-central1-b."
